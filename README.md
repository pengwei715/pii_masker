# pii_masker

### Build the PII data anonymization solution

#### Recognizer

pre-build model or pattern recognizer 

#### Highlighter

Place holder for the highlight solution (now we are using annotated_text)
if we want to do a annotation on HTML, we may need other solution

#### Masker

Replace the PII with labels for now. we can implement other solution to replace it with * or emoji.
